        The <strong>Royal Free, University College and Middlesex Medical Students Association</strong> has a proud and illustrious past. Formed in the wake of the merger between the three constituent medical schools in 1998, it has since gone from strength to strength and now provides social events, sports teams, societies, welfare services and representation to the 1200 or so medical students at UCL Medical School.</p>
        <p>UCL Medical School itself was formed over a number of years from the merger of three different institutions the Middlesex Hospital, University College Hospital and the Royal Free Hospital.</p>       
        <p>The Middlesex Hospital was opened in Fitzrovia in 1745 by Charles Bell and had its first cohort of medical students join in 1746. University College Hospital was opened in 1834 as the North London Hospital, with the purpose of providing the then newly opened University College London with a hospital to train medical students; the governors of the Middlesex Hospital had refused to share its facilities with UCL.

        <h3>Honorary President</h3>
        <p>
          The individual Medical Schools of the Royal Free, University College and Middlesex all came together to form UCL Medical School in 1998. Each had their own proud history and the tradition of these institutions is captured in the name of our Medical Student Society (RUMS) - Royal Free, University College and Middlesex Students.
          <br><br>
          RUMS has two main functions. Firstly it is the elected representative body for Medical Students of UCLMS. Hence it is your voice about educational, welfare and other issues and your bridge to the Faculty. Secondly it is the social and sporting heart of the School with excellent sports teams and other societies
          <br><br>
          It is an organisation with not only an excellent history but also an essential present and a great future. Belong and support! It is yours!

    <h3>Sports</h3>
    <p>Getting involved in RUMS Sport is a decision few students regret. Bonds forged in these teams will carry you through and beyond your time at RUMS. Whether you are a casual player looking to keep fit or a more serious athlete, these clubs cater to the social and sporting needs of people of any level. Most sports also hold a weekly social on a Wednesday, and go on various tours to different parts of the country/abroad.</p>
      
    <p>Notable annual events include RUMS Hockey's matches in the London Varsity Series against KCL, Rugby's Bill Smith's event and football's St. John's Cup event, where the first year medics face off against the the second years, and the Lumsden Cup; an inter-sport netball competition run by RUMS netball where all proceeds go to charity.</p>
      
    <p>All the sports teams will be present at the RUMS Fresher's Fair, and will hold trial days where you can go and get a feel of what it is like to be part of the club with no obligation to sign up. Don't worry if you miss these; as a general rule the clubs are very welcoming, and are happy for you to come down for a trial session, though it best to email them first so they can ensure they can accommodate you.</p>
    <h3>Societies</h3>
    <p>Welcome to RUMS Societies. This is a small yet important section of RUMS life. Not everyone is cut out to be a sportsman and the RUMS affiliated societies cater for that need. Whilst open to non-medics, RUMS Societies are predominantly made up of medical students. Notable events include the MD's Christmas Show – an event not to be missed! Importantly, these societies often act as important support networks for students, with members sharing notes with one another and older years helping younger students with their studies. Get involved early…you won’t regret it!</p>

        <p>As your VPs for Education, it is our role to ensure that your views about the course are accurately communicated to the medical school. It is also our role to ensure that the feedback from the teaching committee is communicated back to you as quickly and clearly as possible. Our role is to create a link between the staff and the students and to promote transparency in how both sides deal with the feedback.</p>
            
            <p>We accomplish this by electing and working with a team of module representatives for each of the modules. As a module representative, your role would be to gather the opinions and views of your student body about your specific module and then providing feed back to the VP for Education for your year as well as the academic leads. Applications to be module representatives will open when term starts in September.</p>
            
            <p>The feedback is communicated to staff in informal feedback sessions and formal meetings such as:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The Student Staff Consultation Committees (SSCCs):</strong> As your VPs for Education, it is our duty to chair SSCCs where we set the agenda and pose our questions and concerns to the staff and ask them to what they have done to achieve previously set goals and what they can do to achieve new goals.</li>
                <li><strong>The Teaching Sub-Committees (TSCs):</strong> These are meetings run by the academic leads where they seek the student views on the course and reasons for student levels of interactions with the medical school.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>As you can see, our role is to represent you, so your opinions and views are vital to us. We look forward to hearing from you throughout this year.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>RUMS has a vast array of resources and contacts available to help medical students through any issues they may face during their 6 years at medical school. Though many students pass through medical school without needing support, rest assured that there will always be a team on hand to help you with any question you may have, no matter how big or small! On this page you should find the various resources you need to get through your time here.</p>
                
                <p>We can offer support on issues such as:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Leaving home, and transitioning to the independence of university life</li>
                    <li>Academic Issues</li>
                    <li>Personal Issues (Social, Family, Sexual)</li>
                    <li>Housing and Financial Problems</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>As well as with many other matters, so please don’t hesitate to get in touch with us if you need help/advice. Confidentiality will be maintained at all times, and we will dothe best we can to work with the medical school to help you out. Remember that you can also talk to your personal tutor or VM tutor.</p>
                
                <p>RUMS Welfare will be putting on various events during the year, including welfare drop-in sessions, exam de-stress events (for preclins and clinical students), and post-results drop-in sessions. Look out for more details on this page, in the RUMS Bulletin, and on Facebook.</p>
                
                <h3>Medics-for-Medics</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Stress is common amongst members of the medical profession, and students are no exception. This scheme aims to make use of the wealth of experience ofRUMS students throughout the years to help others. It’s run by trained medical students, for medical students- so if you have any worries about life in RUMS, or you just fancy a chat with another med student, come by for our weekly drop-in sessions!
                
                Information on where/when the sessions will be held will be advertised via the RUMS Bulletin and on this site.</p>
