        The <strong>Royal Free, University College and Middlesex Medical Students Association</strong> has a proud and illustrious past. Formed in the wake of the merger between the three constituent medical schools in 1998, it has since gone from strength to strength and now provides social events, sports teams, societies, welfare services and representation to the 1200 or so medical students at UCL Medical School.</p>
        <p>UCL Medical School itself was formed over a number of years from the merger of three different institutions the Middlesex Hospital, University College Hospital and the Royal Free Hospital.</p>       
        <p>The Middlesex Hospital was opened in Fitzrovia in 1745 by Charles Bell and had its first cohort of medical students join in 1746. University College Hospital was opened in 1834 as the North London Hospital, with the purpose of providing the then newly opened University College London with a hospital to train medical students; the governors of the Middlesex Hospital had refused to share its facilities with UCL.

        <h3>Honorary President</h3>
        <p>
          The individual Medical Schools of the Royal Free, University College and Middlesex all came together to form UCL Medical School in 1998. Each had their own proud history and the tradition of these institutions is captured in the name of our Medical Student Society (RUMS) - Royal Free, University College and Middlesex Students.
          <br><br>
          RUMS has two main functions. Firstly it is the elected representative body for Medical Students of UCLMS. Hence it is your voice about educational, welfare and other issues and your bridge to the Faculty. Secondly it is the social and sporting heart of the School with excellent sports teams and other societies
          <br><br>
          It is an organisation with not only an excellent history but also an essential present and a great future. Belong and support! It is yours!
